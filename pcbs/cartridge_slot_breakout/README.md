Eagle board file for a PCB to breakout the Atari cartridge slot to 6 x 5 pin male or female headers.
For use on an XL or XE machine.

The side with the connector labelled S-A should be upwards (XE) or facing towards you (XL).

IMPORTANT - On an XL machine, either remove the cartridge flags, or insert something in the slot to avoid
them touching the board - otherwise you risk a short-circuit.
