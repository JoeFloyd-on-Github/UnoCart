Eagle board file for Atari cartridge slot breakout PCB, which breaks out the cartridge slot to 6 x 5 pin headers (male or female).
For use with Atari XL or XE.

On an XE, the side where the connector is labelled S-A should be facing upwards.
On an XL, the S-A side should be facing forwards.

IMPORTANT - on an XL, you should remove the cartridge slot flaps, or insert something in the slot to keep the flaps away from the PCB. Otherwise you risk a short circuit.
